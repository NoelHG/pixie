Pixie, a framework for pixel games

The idea is to save myself and everyone else time and headaches by putting together pretty much all the things you need to make a 2D game like Black Chapter instead of doing it every time. Kind of like a Rails framework for web apps, but for this kind of game instead. It should be modular, customizable, and have good defaults that "just work".

The first thing is to refactor and generalize the code from Black Chapter and put it here if it makes sense to do so. Then, additional features can be included.
