# Pixie
A framework for pixel games

!! Work In Progress !! See my game Black Chapter to see what you can expect to build with this.

The idea is to save myself and everyone else time and headaches by putting together pretty much all the things you need to make a 2D game like Black Chapter instead of doing it every time. Kind of like a Rails framework for web apps, but for this kind of game instead. It should be modular, customizable, and have good defaults that "just work".

The first thing is to refactor and generalize the code from Black Chapter and put it here if it makes sense to do so. Then, additional features can be included.

Features:

  2D Dynamic Layer Ordering
  Animations
  Deterministic Movement
  Event System (With Queue)
  Game State Control
  Interactions (Characters / Objects)
  Items & Inventory
  Pathing For 2D
  Player & Camera Control
  Save/Load
  Scene Management
  Sound System
  UI
  Useful Helper Functions & Prebuilt Unity Objects
